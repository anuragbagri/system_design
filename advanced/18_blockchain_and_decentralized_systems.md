# Blockchain & Decentralized System Design (Advanced)

## Overview

Blockchain and decentralized systems rely on distributed consensus, immutable ledgers, and cryptographic guarantees. Useful for some trust-minimized applications.

## Core Concepts

- Consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, BFT)
- Smart contracts and execution environments
- Sharding and scalability efforts
- Off-chain computation and layer-2 solutions

## Trade-offs

- High latency and cost compared to centralized systems
- Complex security model and attack surface
- Storage requirements and pruning strategies

## Use Cases

- Public ledgers, token economies, decentralized identity, supply chain provenance

## Best Practices

- Carefully review economic incentives and attack vectors
- Use audited smart contract patterns and formal verification where necessary
- Consider hybrid architectures (trusted components + ledger)
