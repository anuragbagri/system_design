# Security & Privacy in Advanced Systems

## Overview

Advanced systems must balance performance, scalability, and strong security/privacy guarantees.

## Key Areas

- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy, anonymization)
- Secure key and secret management

## Design Considerations

- Threat modeling early in the design
- Performance impact of cryptography
- Compliance and auditability

## Operational Practices

- Rotating keys and certificates
- Least privilege and role separation
- Secure CI/CD pipelines and artifact signing

## Best Practices

- Bake security into architecture decisions
- Automate vulnerability scanning and patching
- Provide clear incident response plans
