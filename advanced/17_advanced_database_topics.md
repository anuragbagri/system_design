# Advanced Database Topics (Advanced)

## Overview

Covers modern distributed database concepts: NewSQL, TrueTime/Spanner ideas, consensus protocols, and high-availability design patterns.

## Topics

- Consensus protocols: Paxos, Raft
- Spanner/TrueTime concepts for global consistency
- NewSQL databases (CockroachDB, YugabyteDB)
- Multi-region replication and conflict resolution

## Design Considerations

- Trade-offs between latency and global consistency
- Partitioning and topology-aware placement
- Operational complexity and schema evolution

## Best Practices

- Choose the right tool for needs (transactional vs analytical)
- Test failure modes and leader elections
- Monitor replication lag and write latencies

## References

- Raft and Paxos papers
- Spanner architecture
