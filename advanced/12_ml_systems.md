# Machine Learning System Design (Advanced)

## Overview

ML system design addresses data pipelines, model training at scale, feature stores, and model serving with reliability and reproducibility.

## Components

- Data ingestion and feature pipelines
- Feature store and versioning
- Distributed training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model registry, serving, and A/B testing
- Monitoring for model drift and data quality

## Considerations

- Data freshness vs reproducibility
- Training cost and large-scale resource management
- Serving latency and batching strategies
- Explainability and fairness concerns

## Tools

- TensorFlow/PyTorch, Kubeflow, MLflow, Seldon, Tecton

## Best Practices

- Version data and models together
- Use feature stores for consistency between training and serving
- Monitor model performance in production and retrain proactively
