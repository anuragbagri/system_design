# Edge Computing & IoT (Advanced)

## Overview

Edge computing pushes computation and storage nearer to devices to reduce latency, preserve bandwidth, and enable offline capabilities for IoT and mobile scenarios.

## Patterns

- Data aggregation at the edge
- Device-to-edge sync and batching
- Local decision making and ML inference on-device

## Challenges

- Limited resources (CPU, memory, power)
- Intermittent connectivity and eventual consistency
- Device management and secure provisioning

## Tools & Frameworks

- Edge runtimes (K3s, K3OS), IoT platforms (AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub)
- Lightweight ML runtimes (TensorFlow Lite)

## Best Practices

- Keep edge components small and resilient
- Prioritize secure provisioning and OTA updates
- Design synchronization and reconciliation carefully
