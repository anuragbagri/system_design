# Case Studies

This folder contains real-world system design case studies. Each file outlines architecture components, key features, technical implementation details, challenges, best practices, and lessons.

Case studies included:

- `netflix_architecture.md` — global streaming, CDN, recommendations, resilience patterns.
- `uber_architecture.md` — real-time matching, geospatial services, surge pricing.
- `whatsapp_architecture.md` — low-latency messaging, E2EE, offline delivery.
- `twitter_architecture.md` — high-cardinality fan-out, timeline generation, personalization.
- `spotify_architecture.md` — music streaming, offline sync, recommendation pipelines.
- `gmail_architecture.md` — email ingestion, search, spam detection, indexing.

Recommended reading order:

1. `netflix_architecture.md` (CDN, streaming, large-scale resilience)
2. `whatsapp_architecture.md` (messaging at scale)
3. `uber_architecture.md` (real-time geospatial systems)
4. `twitter_architecture.md` (fan-out and personalization)
5. `spotify_architecture.md` (streaming + ML recommendations)
6. `gmail_architecture.md` (indexing and search at scale)
