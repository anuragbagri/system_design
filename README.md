## Learning Approach

1. Start with the basics and understand fundamental concepts
2. Move to intermediate topics once comfortable with basics
3. Practice with case studies
4. Dive into advanced topics
5. Regular practice and review
6. Build small systems to apply concepts
7. Review real-world system designs
8. Prepare for system design interviews

## Tips for Learning

- Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing
- Practice designing systems on paper
- Review existing system designs
- Participate in system design discussions
- Build small projects to apply concepts
- Stay updated with new technologies and patterns
- Practice explaining your designs
- Learn from failures and edge cases

## Repository structure

This repository contains curated notes and case studies to take you from fundamentals to advanced system design topics.

- `basics/` — foundational notes and core concepts. Start here if you're new to system design.
- `intermediate/` — patterns and architectures once you know the basics (microservices, queues, DB scaling).
- `advanced/` — advanced topics (tracing, consistency models, stream processing, resilience, security).
- `case_studies/` — real-world system design examples (Netflix, Uber, WhatsApp, Twitter, Spotify, Gmail).

Recommended learning path:

1. Read `basics/` to learn core concepts and terminology.
2. Work through `intermediate/` to understand common architectures and trade-offs.
3. Study `case_studies/` to see real-world applications and decisions.
4. Dive into `advanced/` for deep-dive patterns, performance, and resilience.

Contributing

- Add content as new markdown files in their respective folders.
- Follow the existing document style: concise headings, components, trade-offs, and best practices.
- Suggest references or diagrams by linking to external resources or adding image files in the repo.

If you'd like, I can also add a top-level quick-start checklist or a visual roadmap image to this README.
