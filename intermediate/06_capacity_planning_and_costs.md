# Capacity Planning & Cost Optimization (Intermediate)

## Overview

Capacity planning forecasts resource needs and balances cost with performance. Cost optimization ensures efficient use of infrastructure while meeting SLAs.

## Key Activities

- Traffic and usage forecasting
- Load testing to determine capacity curves
- Right-sizing instances and services
- Auto-scaling policies and safety margins

## Cost Strategies

- Use spot/preemptible instances where appropriate
- Use reserved/capacity plans for predictable workloads
- Delete unused resources and orphaned disks
- Choose serverless or managed services for lower operational overhead

## Metrics

- Peak RPS, CPU and memory percentiles, queue lengths
- Cost per request, cost per user, ROI of feature launches

## Best Practices

- Run regular cost reviews with engineering and finance
- Automate tagging and cost allocation
- Optimize storage (tiering, lifecycle policies)
